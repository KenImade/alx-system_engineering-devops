# Shell, init files, variables and expansions

This project is part of the ALx Full Stack Software Engineering programme.

The objectives of this project are the following:

- To understand the Shell Initialization Files eg `/etc/profile/`, `/etc/profile.d`
- To understand the various type of shell variables local and global
- What is expansion and how to use them
- How to do command substitution with `$()` and backticks
- How to perform arithmetic operations with the shell
- How to create an alias

**All files are executable scripts**
